You are almost there. Hang in there. Now, click on **Terminal**. It is located near the top left. Then, click on **New Terminal**.
Now, let us connect remotely on Terminal. Type in ssh your CSE 15L account plus @ieng6.ucsd.edu. So, if your CSE 15L account is cs15lsp23ab, you will have to type in **ssh cs15lsp23ab@ieng6.ucsd.edu** right after the $ on the terminal. Then, hit enter.

Congrats!! You finally logged in remotely to the server.
## STEP 4: Trying some commands
Now, you are ready play with some commands on the terminal.
Type in something like
1. cd
2. ls
3. pwd
4. mkdir
5. cp

You will see these after you try those commands.
I will explain what each command means:
* cd means changing directory. This command lets you go into another directory. You need to type in the name of the directory after cd. If the name of directory is dir2, you need to type in cd dir2
* ls stands for list. ls lists all the files within your current directory.
* pwd stands for print working directory. pwd prints the full path of your current directory. It lists all the parent directories.
* mkdir stands for make directory. This command makes or creates a directory.
* cp stands for copy. This command lets you create a copy of the contents of the file or directory.
