# Lab Report 5
## Part 1 – Debugging Scenario
Student
Title: I keep getting this message from the debugger when I try to test if every file works smoothly in Lab 7 

What environment are you using (computer, operating system, web browser, terminal/editor, and so on)?
I am using a PC laptop, Windows, Visual Studio Code, and terminal.



Detail the symptom you're seeing. Be specific; include both what you're seeing and what you expected to see instead. Screenshots are great, copy-pasted terminal output is also great. Avoid saying “it doesn't work”.

Detail the failure-inducing input and context. That might mean any or all of the command you're running, a test case, command-line arguments, working directory, even the last few commands you ran. Do your best to provide as much context as you can.
